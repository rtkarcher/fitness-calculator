Fitness Calculator
===

This application was created as an effort of the [Alzheimer's Disease Center](http://www.kualzheimers.org/) at the [University of Kansas Medical Center](http://www.kumc.edu/).

The metabolic calculation algorithms used for the fitness rankings produced are derived from those published by the [American College of Sports Medicine Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription, 9th Ed.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4139760/) (currently under peer review). 

More information on the metabolic equations used to calculate VO2 max scores can be found via the [ACSM website](http://certification.acsm.org/metabolic-calcs).
